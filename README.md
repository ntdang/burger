# Nom Nom Burgers!

A burger logger application that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and uses Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Nom Nom Burgers! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Nom Nom button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database whether devoured or not.
